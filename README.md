# Switch Interface Maps
This is a collection of interface mapping files, that allow virtual devices e.g. cEOS or vEOS interface names to be mapped to those matching physical devices. 

For further details on how to use this feature (Arbitrary Interface Mapping on vEOS and cEOS) please refer to the TOI.

The collection is split between [Datacenter](./Datacenter/) and [Campus](./Campus/) platforms.
